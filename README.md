Otherwise, you can also choose to clone the repo onto your local machine. After cloning the repo, run the index.html file to view the website.


## Usage

Deployed webpage can be found [here](https://highwolfx.github.io/). The links on the top navigation bar are responsive and will lead to other pages. The links in the bottom of the page, in the footer, are also responsive and will lead to external social media sites.

The "About"

On the ["Portfolio"](https://highwolfx.github.io/portfolio.html) page, the images are on a carousel and clicking them will lead to the associated github project page for the Coding Projects in a new tab. To scroll between the various images, click on the left/right sides of the carousel near the chevrons, or navigate the slides using the tabs at the bottom center.
